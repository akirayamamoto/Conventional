## To install from NuGet

    Install-Package Best.Conventional

Looking for Roslyn-based conventions? Check out [the documentation](https://github.com/andrewabest/Conventional/wiki/Roslyn-Conventions) for more information.

Conventional.Roslyn does not target .NET Standard 2.0 due to there being [no official .NET Core support](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/17974) for `MSBuildWorkspace`, a core building block of Roslyn. 

## Documentation

To get started with Conventional, please check out [the wiki](https://github.com/andrewabest/Conventional/wiki) for a comprehensive list of included conventions, sample usages, and configuration information.

## Contributing

Conventional's test suite requires a default named `.\SQLEXPRESS` instance. If you have another instance you would like to use for development, create a copy of `development.settings.example` in the solution root and rename to `development.settings`, and supply your own connection string.
